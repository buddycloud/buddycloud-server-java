# Buddycloud Java Server implementation

Note: This server is not as fully featured as the nodejs server https://github.com/buddycloud/buddycloud-server.

Not yet implemented:

- Caching (server always goes to remote server to collect data)
- Special nodes
- MAM/Sync (not caching so no need so far)

Currently the server has enough features that it is usable. It federates with remote servers but may appear to be slow due to lack of caching.

## Build status

Note this points to the main buddycloud repository for the java server.
